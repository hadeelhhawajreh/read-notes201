Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

# HTML provides us with three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
  + ``<ol>``
   The ordered list is created with the ``<ol>`` element.
  + ``<li>`` Each item in the list is placed between an opening ``<li>`` tag and a closing ``</li>`` tag. (The li stands for list item.)
  Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the ``<ol>`` element to specify the type of numbering (numbers, letters, roman numerals and so on). It is better to use the CSS liststyle-type
  
  >code :
  
  ``<ol>``
  
``<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>``

``<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender</li>``

``<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>``

``<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>``

``<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>``

``</ol>``

> execute the code :

<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>

  
  
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

  + ``<ul>`` The unordered list is created with the ``<ul>`` element. ``<li>`` Each item in the list is placed between an opening ``<li>`` tag and a closing ``</li>`` tag. (The li stands for list item.)
  + Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the <ul> element to specify the type of bullet point (circles, squares, diamonds and so on). It is better to use the CSS list-styletype.
  > code :
  
``<ul>``

``<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>``

``<li>100ml milk</li>``

``<li>50g salted butter</li>``

``<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>``

``<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>``

``</ul>``

> execute the code :

<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

  + ``<dl>`` The definition list is created with the ``<dl>`` element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the ``<dl>`` element you will
usually see pairs of ``<dt>`` and ``<dd>`` elements.
  + ``<dt>`` This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term). ``<dd>`` This is used to contain the definition.
  
  >code:
  
 `` <dl>``
 
``<dt>Sashimi</dt>``

``<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with condiments such as shredded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>``

``<dt>Scale</dt>``

``<dd>A device used to accurately measure the weight of ingredients</dd>``

``<dd>A technique by which the scales are remove from the skin of a fish</dd>``

``<dt>Scamorze</dt>``

``<dt>Scamorzo</dt>``

``<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole cow's milk (although it was traditionally made from buffalo milk)</dd>``

> execute the code :

``</dl>``
<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with  condiments such as shredded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the  weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are remove  from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole  cow's milk (although it was traditionally made  from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>

CSS...
+ Box Dimensions

By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties. The most popular ways to
specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems

+ Limiting Width (min-width, max-width)
Some page designs expand and
shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the
min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be
displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the
max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can
stretch to when the browser
window is wide.

+ Limiting Height(min-height, max-height)

In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.

+ overflow
The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
   + hidden
   This property simply hides any
   extra content that does not fit in
   the box.
   + scroll
   This property adds a scrollbar to
   the box so that users can scroll
   to see the missing content.
   
 
 Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
 ![BOX](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png)
 
  + Border
   Every box has a border (even if
   it is not visible or is specified to
   be 0 pixels wide). The border
   separates the edge of one box
   from another.
  + Margin
    Margins sit outside the edge
    of the border. You can set the
    width of a margin to create a
    gap between the borders of two
   adjacent boxes.
   
   + Padding
     Padding is the space between
     the border of a box and any
     content contained within it.
     Adding padding can increase the
     readability of its contents.
