CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:


Normal flow: Every block-level element appears on a new line. (This is the default behavior)

Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

Absolute positioning: Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

Fixed Positioning: this is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.

Floating Elements: floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

 CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.
+ Normal flow
Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

+ Flexbox
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals. After studying this guide you can test your flexbox skills to check your understanding before moving on.

+ Grids
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout, then test your grid skills before moving on.

+ Why CSS Grid Layout?

Grid CSS is by far the best CSS out there(not yet) to divide a web page into defined regions with full control on their re-positions. Previously when we start designing a website, we had to carefully write the HTML elements in an order. After CSS Grid Layout, this will not be necessary. Order of the elements inside a Grid Layout can be changed as we wish.

+ This feature is what I think is the game changer. There are other wonderful features that you can look up here.

+ How useful is CSS Grid Layout?

CSS Grid solves a lot of existing problems. I can show you one such problem we often face in web designing.


+ Floats
Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.

+ Positioning:


Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position values, and how to use them.

+ Multiple-column layout:  

The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper. This article explains how to use this feature.

+ Responsive design:

As more diverse screen sizes have appeared on web-enabled devices, the concept of responsive web design (RWD) has appeared: a set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.
