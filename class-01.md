# How Websites Are Created?
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

# How the Web Works?

+ When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site.

+ Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.

+ The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

+ The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
